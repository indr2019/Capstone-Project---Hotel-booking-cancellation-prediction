# Capstone-Project-Hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction
The task of this project is to predict which hotel bookings are likely to cancel. This is a classification problem. The dataset is based on attributes that contribute to cancellations for hotel bookings, for a period of 3 years.
# Purpose of the project
Booking cancellations have significant impact on demand-management decisions in the hospitality industry. To mitigate the effect of cancellations, hotels implement rigid cancellation policies and overbooking tactics, which in turn can have a negative impact on revenue and on the hotel reputation. This model can help hotels better manage the bookings in their respective booking management system by predicting booking cancelations and thus mitigate possible losses occuring out of such cancellations
